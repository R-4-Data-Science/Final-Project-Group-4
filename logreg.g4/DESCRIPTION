Title: Logistic Regression Using Optimization
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ava White & Bukola Ayodele
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: This package contains functions for calculating a logistic regression
    using optimization to find an estimated Beta, using a least-squares formula
    to generate initial values for the optimization, and bootstrapping and 
    generating confidence intervals. You are also able to plot the logistic curve
    based on responses, generate a confusion matrix that outputs prevalence,
    accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, false discovery rate, and the diagnostic
    odds ratio, and plotting any of these metrics over a grid cutoff value.
